### Poker - 5 Card Stud - Solitaire

Game can be played with either one or two hole cards and with 2 to 5 players.

Unlike a real game, and unlike many other online games, all cards are dealt at once.  Some players will automatically fold their hands, since the computer can see all of the other players up-cards.  At this point you make your bet and all the remaining players call.

The game can also be played as you against a millionaire.  You start with $100 and he starts with a million. If you're carefull, you can generally get all his money in less than an hour.

Game works best in a desktop or laptop browser or on a tablet.
